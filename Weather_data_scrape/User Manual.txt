1. You should download the files from NWS
2. You have copy those file and put it in 'Process_Folder'
3. If you don't find any 'Process_Folder' then create one with exactly same name
4. You should put valid text file in the 'Process_Folder'
5. After that just double click 'main.py'
6. For each file it will take 2 seconds to process


Note: 

1. The script will process all the text file in 'Process_Folder'
2. So Do NOT put any redundent text file in that folder
3. You should DELETE all the file before inserting to 'Process_Folder'
4. If there is old text file in 'Process_Folder', script will convert that too
5. If you put invalid file, or if system can't process, then script can stop
6. If you face trouble processing multiple file, try one by one.
7. If a single valid file troubles processing, keep that file and contact with me

Disclosure:
** Any format change in data can make the script broken
** In that case, contact with me. We may have to repair it on different contract
** I tried to make it as much dynamic as possible.
